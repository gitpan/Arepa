0.90  Mon Sep  5 16:59:31 CEST 2011

        - Add a daemon (arepa-job-daemon) to process that queue
          constantly in the background

          to integrate with Apache authentication, LDAP or whatever)

0.88  Mon Jul  4 16:46:33 CEST 2011
        - Make it compatible with sbuild 0.60.8... and incompatible with
          anything older, I imagine.

        - Fix "arepa queue xxx.dsc <distroname>"
        - Add a simple option to show a source package in the repo

0.87  Tue Mar  1 13:53:57 CET 2011
        - Don't require the sqlite3 utility to run the tests, just
          DBD::SQLite
        - One more compatibility fix for Mojolicious 1.0 (login was
          apparently broken)

0.86  Fri Feb 25 14:26:06 CET 2011
        - Compatibility with Mojolicious 1.0
        - Support unsigned repositories, to make the functional tests
          easier to execute

0.85  Thu Jan 20 10:35:46 CET 2011
        - Compatibility with sbuild 0.60 (ie. Debian Squeeze)
        - Add workaround multi-arch packages (not proper support, but they'll
          sort of work), as in packages having more than one value in
          Architecture (like "amd64 i386", not like "any"; the latter has
          always worked)
        - Fix some problem with incoming packages that are themselves binNMUs
          or otherwise have "funny" revision numbers
        - Undo stupid hack for old versions of reprepro that interchanged the
          priority and section fields
        - Give sane defaults for comments, section and priority for incoming
          packages
        - Add a command to request compilation of source packages in a given
          distribution and architecture
        - Fix some nasty problem when creating new builders (when passing a
          trailing backslash in the builder path, that builder would not be
          able to compile any package, and give really strange errors)
        - A lot of refactoring and internal improvements

0.81  Fri Aug 20 14:26:09 CEST 2010
        - Fix MANIFEST file and other minor packaging bugs

0.80  Fri Aug 20 14:05:34 CEST 2010
        - Rewrote the whole web UI in Mojolicious instead of CGI::Application
        - Encode packager name correctly
        - Add information about the remote repository synchronization status
          (see web_ui:check_remote_repo configuration key)
        - Add a button to easily synchronize the remote repository
        - When approving all packages, honour the comments, priority and
          section for each package
        - Add an option to see (and import) uploader GPG keys on the web UI
        - Add createdistribution command to arepa-admin
        - Improve the installation instructions considerably
        - Minor improvements in administration tasks
        - Deprecate web_ui:cgi_base_url, not needed anymore
        - Add a new configuration key, web_ui:public_url, which will be used
          for the RSS feeds and other "public URL" needs
        - Make the Arepa::BuilderFarm tests more reliable, they should always
          pass now on CPANTS

0.76  Tue Jul 13 11:27:33 CEST 2010
        - Make App::Repository tests depend on an environment variable
          $REPREPRO4PATH (ie. be nice to CPANTS)
        - Small fixes in the web UI (remove extra quote, set explicit charset,
          show a message when the compilation queue is empty, improve the
          build log page a bit)
        - Allow creating builders of specific architectures (useful when you
          are running amd64 and want a builder for i386)
        - Fix RSS link (doh!)

0.75  Wed Jun  2 13:42:56 CEST 2010
        - It turns out it wasn't completely fixed, oh well
        - Add missing dependency YAML::Syck to Makefile.PL

          fixed

0.73  Thu Mar 18 13:39:35 CET 2010
        - Fix stupid bug introduced in 0.71 ("Support incoming ...") that
          would do horrible things when having any binNMUs configured

0.72  Thu Mar 18 11:28:50 CET 2010
        - Implement an "uninit" command in arepa-admin
        - Make both init and uninit receive an optional list of builders to
          init/uninit (as opposed to init/uninit all of them)
        - Don't use the -n option in sudo, as it's only supported from 1.7.0
        - Remove the silly signing script, as it's not needed if sudo is
          configured properly
        - Add/improve documentation everywhere, add legal information

0.71  Wed Mar 17 14:01:36 CET 2010
        - Store passwords as MD5-hashes in the users file
        - Add support for rejecting incoming packages
        - Support incoming source packages with a distribution that is not a
          reprepro distribution Suite or Codename (still, that distribution
          will have to be mentioned in some builder)
        - Added introductory documentation, improved a bit the help/error
          messages on the command-line tools

        - Order failed compilations by finished date, not requested date
        - Add the ability to add comments to source packages
        - Add a repository view showing all the available packages
        - Add a repository signing script and make sure the repository is
          signed every time there are changes (new source/binary packages)

0.65  Wed Feb 17 13:33:38 CET 2010
        - Show since when a package has been compiling in the "Builder status"
        - Add the --delete option to the rsync calls
        - Fix binNMU calculations so binNMUs are correctly detected
        - Fix "Latest xxx" listing order
