0.76  Tue Jul 13 11:27:33 CEST 2010
        - Make App::Repository tests depend on an environment variable
          $REPREPRO4PATH (ie. be nice to CPANTS)
        - Small fixes in the web UI (remove extra quote, set explicit charset,
          show a message when the compilation queue is empty, improve the
          build log page a bit)
        - Allow creating builders of specific architectures (useful when you
          are running amd64 and want a builder for i386)
        - Fix RSS link (doh!)

0.75  Wed Jun  2 13:42:56 CEST 2010
        - It turns out it wasn't completely fixed, oh well
        - Add missing dependency YAML::Syck to Makefile.PL
        - Escape the source package comment
        - Add a simple RSS feed for incoming packages

0.74  Thu Mar 18 14:56:41 CET 2010
        - More fixes for the 0.71 bug, hopefully this time it's completely
          fixed

0.73  Thu Mar 18 13:39:35 CET 2010
        - Fix stupid bug introduced in 0.71 ("Support incoming ...") that
          would do horrible things when having any binNMUs configured

0.72  Thu Mar 18 11:28:50 CET 2010
        - Implement an "uninit" command in arepa-admin
        - Make both init and uninit receive an optional list of builders to
          init/uninit (as opposed to init/uninit all of them)
        - Don't use the -n option in sudo, as it's only supported from 1.7.0
        - Remove the silly signing script, as it's not needed if sudo is
          configured properly
        - Add/improve documentation everywhere, add legal information

0.71  Wed Mar 17 14:01:36 CET 2010
        - Store passwords as MD5-hashes in the users file
        - Add support for rejecting incoming packages
        - Support incoming source packages with a distribution that is not a
          reprepro distribution Suite or Codename (still, that distribution
          will have to be mentioned in some builder)
        - Added introductory documentation, improved a bit the help/error
          messages on the command-line tools

0.70  Mon Mar 15 14:04:43 CET 2010
        - Order failed compilations by finished date, not requested date
        - Add the ability to add comments to source packages
        - Add a repository view showing all the available packages
        - Add a repository signing script and make sure the repository is
          signed every time there are changes (new source/binary packages)

0.65  Wed Feb 17 13:33:38 CET 2010
        - Show since when a package has been compiling in the "Builder status"
        - Add the --delete option to the rsync calls
        - Fix binNMU calculations so binNMUs are correctly detected
        - Fix "Latest xxx" listing order
