        - When approving all packages, honour the comments, priority and
          section for each package

        - Add createdistribution command to arepa-admin
        - Improve the installation instructions considerably
        - Minor improvements in administration tasks
        - Deprecate web_ui:cgi_base_url, not needed anymore

          for the RSS feeds and other "public URL" needs
        - Make the Arepa::BuilderFarm tests more reliable, they should always

0.76  Tue Jul 13 11:27:33 CEST 2010
        - Make App::Repository tests depend on an environment variable
          $REPREPRO4PATH (ie. be nice to CPANTS)
        - Small fixes in the web UI (remove extra quote, set explicit charset,
          show a message when the compilation queue is empty, improve the
          build log page a bit)
        - Allow creating builders of specific architectures (useful when you
          are running amd64 and want a builder for i386)
        - Fix RSS link (doh!)

0.75  Wed Jun  2 13:42:56 CEST 2010
        - It turns out it wasn't completely fixed, oh well
        - Add missing dependency YAML::Syck to Makefile.PL

          fixed

0.73  Thu Mar 18 13:39:35 CET 2010
        - Fix stupid bug introduced in 0.71 ("Support incoming ...") that
          would do horrible things when having any binNMUs configured

0.72  Thu Mar 18 11:28:50 CET 2010
        - Implement an "uninit" command in arepa-admin
        - Make both init and uninit receive an optional list of builders to
          init/uninit (as opposed to init/uninit all of them)
        - Don't use the -n option in sudo, as it's only supported from 1.7.0
        - Remove the silly signing script, as it's not needed if sudo is
          configured properly
        - Add/improve documentation everywhere, add legal information

        - Add support for rejecting incoming packages

          messages on the command-line tools

          signed every time there are changes (new source/binary packages)

0.65  Wed Feb 17 13:33:38 CET 2010
        - Show since when a package has been compiling in the "Builder status"
        - Add the --delete option to the rsync calls
