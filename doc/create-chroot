# When installing the 'arepa' package:
# * Create a user arepa-master
# * Make that user part of the group 'sbuild'
# * Make sure the directories /var/arepa/logs and /var/arepa/stats exist and
#   are writable by arepa-master (/var/arepa is the home directory for
#   arepa-master)
# * /etc/apache2/sites-available/arepa-internal-repository will be part of the
#   package. There has to be a notice somewhere that it has to be activated, or
#   a similar configuration has to be converted to a different webserver
# Alias /arepa-repository /var/arepa/repository
# <Location /arepa-repository>
#     Options +Indexes
# </Location>
# <Location /arepa-repository/conf>
#     Order Deny,Allow
#     Deny From All
# </Location>
# <Location /arepa-repository/db>
#     Order Deny,Allow
#     Deny From All
# </Location>
# # Maybe add something about only accessing from the same host? At least,
# # commented out
# * Create the reprepro configuration file
# /var/arepa/repository/conf/distributions?


# Steps to create a new builder:
# * Have to give some option for the type of builder (schroot or other)
# * Have to give some option for the "personality", at least for schroot
# The sources.list might need some tweaking afterwards (distribution name or
# URL for the local repo)
