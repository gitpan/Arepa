* Create the postinst scripts so /var/arepa/gnupg-web is created on package
  installation (see --list-keys and the contents of the default option file
  inside it)
* Create a default keyring with the Opera key, and make it part of the
  distribution (use it for the initial /var/arepa/keyring/uploaders.gpg)
* Figure out some permissions for package.db that work for both www-data and
  arepa-master. Should package.db be created by default as an empty database?

* The user, after installation, will have to "su - arepa-master" and create a
  new GPG key for it. The secret key ID should be in the configuration

* Make www-data be part of a new group, arepa. That group should be the group
  for all the interesting directories, and those directories should have the
  gid bit set.
* Have to set the umask to 0002 to reprepro creates the files with the
  appropriate permissions

-------

* sometimes installation of build-essential and such fails
* it would be nice having the canonical distribution name when generating the
  apt sources line so it just works
* it would be good having some tool to either generate the reprepro
  configuration file (and builders?) or at least make sure you have everything
  in sync.
